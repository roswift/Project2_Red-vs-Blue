## Activity File:  Interview Questions 

### Instructions

The work you did on this project cuts across a wide range of topics: network security logging and monitoring, offensive and defensive security.

When networking and talking to potential employers, you should know how to discuss the work you did on your project to address specific interview questions or to show your skills within a specific domain. This section will teach you how to do this.

First, you will choose a domain that you are interested in pursuing as a career. For this project, you will choose from among the following domains:

-  Network Security

-  Logging & Monitoring

- Offensive Security

- Defensive Security: Incident Response Phases I & II

If you are unsure of which domain you would like to focus on, that's ok! You can either choose the one that you are the most comfortable discussing, or you can also complete the tasks in two or three domains.

For each domain, you will be provided a set of interview questions.  For each question, you will be prompted to think about specific aspects or tasks you completed in Project 2 that you can use to answer the question.

In this section, you will:

- Select one domain and one question.

- Write a one-page response that answers the question using specific examples from your work on Project . Your response should flow and read like a presentation while still keeping the general structure of the technical question response guidelines. 


A good response includes the following: 


- Restate the Problem

- Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

- Explain the Solution Requirements

- Explain the Solution Details

- Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution​

Including each of these components will ensure you provide the interviewer with proof of competency of subject matter and critical thinking. 

**Submission Guidelines​**: You will submit your one-page response. At the end of the project, you will have the opportunity to present your answer if you desire

### Common Interview Questions

Below you will find a list of questions, grouped by specific domains. Select one question to answer. 

For each question, feel free to use the provided prompts to structure each section of your response.

#### Question 1: Intrusion Detection Systems

"What does an intrusion detection system (IDS) do and how does it do it?"

1.  Restate the Problem

2.  Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

    -   In Project 2, which logging and monitoring systems were in place?

    -   Which kinds of data did these systems collect?

    -   Which kinds of data did these systems not collect?

1.  Explain the Solution Requirements

    -   What did Kibana do while you performed your engagement on Day 1?

    -   What did you use Kibana for on Day 2?

    -   How did Kibana capture the data that it did?

    -   Hint: Provide the names of the specific packages that collect data.

1.  Explain the Solution Details

    -   Did Kibana collect logs from all machines on the network? If not, which machines did not send logs to Kibana?

    -   How could Kibana be configured to capture some of the data that it did not collect?

    -   Which tools did you use to analyze the data: search, queries, dashboards, etc.?

1.  Identify Advantages and Disadvantages of the Solution

    -   Should all machines on a network be subject to monitoring?

    -   How do you decide which metrics to monitor?

#### Question 2: HIDS vs NIDS

"What is the difference between a HIDS and a NIDS? When would Blue Team operatives use one over the other?"

1.  Restate the Problem

2.  Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

    -   In Project 2, which logging and monitoring systems were in place?

    -   Which kinds of data did these systems collect?

    -   Which kinds of data did these systems not collect?

    -   Do these sorts and sources of data make any of these systems a HIDS or NIDS?

1.  Explain the Solution Requirements

    -   What did Kibana do while you performed your engagement on Day 1?

    -   What did you use Kibana for on Day 2?

    -   Which VMs did Kibana collect data from?

1.  Explain the Solution Details

    -   How, specifically, do you know Kibana is a HIDS or NIDS?

    -   How could Kibana be configured to capture some of the data that it did not collect?

    -   Which tools did you use to analyze the data -- search, queries, dashboards, etc.?

1.  Identify Advantages and Disadvantages of the Solution

    -   Can a network have both HIDS and NIDS?

    -   Should a network have both HIDS and NIDS?

    -   When is it appropriate to use a HIDS?

    -   When is it appropriate to use a NIDS?

#### Question 3: Dashboards

Why are dashboards so important for log analysis?

1.  Restate the Problem

2.  Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

    -   In Project 2, which logging and monitoring systems were in place?

    -   Which kinds of data did these systems collect?

    -   Which kinds of data did these systems not collect?

1.  Explain the Solution Requirements

    -   What did you use Kibana for on Day 2? 

    -   What kinds of data did you look for during your analysis?

    -   Which tools did you use to analyze the data -- search, queries, dashboards, etc.?

    -   Relative to the other tools, how much did you use dashboards and why?

1.  Explain the Solution Details

    -   Which dashboards did you use? Give at least three specific examples, including:

    -   The name of the chart

    -   The type of data on the plot axes (e.g., # of Requests vs Time)

    -   What kind of activity it indicates

    -   Recall the first "interesting" dashboard you examined. What stood out? Which dashboard did it lead you to next?

1.  Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution

    -   Suppose you couldn't use dashboards. Which tools would you use instead?

    -   Which dashboards were most useful?

    -   Describe at least one dashboard you wish you had, but which does not exist.
