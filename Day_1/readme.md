### Attack!

Today, you will act as an offensive security Red Team to exploit a vulnerable Capstone VM.

You will need to use the following tools, in no particular order:
- Firefox
- Hydra
- Nmap
- John the Ripper
- Metasploit
- curl
- MSVenom

### Setup

Your entire attack will take place using the `Kali Linux` Machine.

- Inside the HyperV Manager, double-click on the `Kali` machine to bring up the VM login window.

- Login with the credentials: `root:toor`

### Instructions

Complete the following to find the flag:

- Discover the IP address of the Linux web server.
- Locate the hidden directory on the web server.
- Brute force the password for the hidden directory using the hydra command:
- Break the hashed password with the Crack Station website or John the Ripper.
- Connect to the server via WebDav.
- Upload a PHP reverse shell payload.
- Execute payload that you uploaded to the site to open up a meterpreter session.
